The Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) is one of Canada's three primary government sources 
of research funding that was established on May 1, 1978. NSERC provides grants for the natural sciences and engineering research,
to supports students, undergraduate, postsecondary and postdoctoral fellows, in their advanced studies. In addition, 
the agency supports postsecondary professors, as an individual or teams, by funding research and fosters innovation and 
encouraging Canadian companies to participate and invest in postsecondary research and training [1-2]. NSERC is public body, 
therefore, the budgets and history of funds are available online and accessible for all sectors for measuring inputs and outputs. Over the last 10 years, NSERC has invested more than $7 billion in researches under three main program areas: research partnerships between institutions and industry, research grants and the training of Canada’s of scientists and engineers [1,3]. The level of funding for each research subject and how it changes over years, are interesting information that would help researchers to apply for different grants. 
Innovations in the field of Science and Engineering is dramatically changing and growing due to the continuous introduction of
new technologies. Generally, Industries are looking for researchers to either examine the quality of their products or to create
new generations of their technologies. This has impacted the job market and increases the demand by the industries to hire 
engineers and scientist with postgraduate degrees, which also reflected on the increasing interest of undergraduate students in 
postgraduate studies. These factors and others have influenced the growing in the funding grants amounts and create more and 
specific research fields. 
The purpose of this project is to provide statistical information that will permit a better understanding of the recent changes
that occurred in partnerships grants, between institutions and industry, and research grants in Canada in various fields 
comprising sciences and engineering. In addition, to find out if there is any correlation between the funding amounts received by
a researcher and partnerships grants. This information is derived from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council’s 
database. 
NSERC Award Databases
 The NSERC award databases are stored in a relational format, and I transferred it to R to access the databases directly. 
 The NSERC award database contains 32 attributes (in 25 tables). The data represents 21 distinct types of information 
 (there are 5 keys duplicated in award and in each of the other tables, and 5 titles given in both English and French). 
 There are two more databases: Co-Applicants and Partners.
